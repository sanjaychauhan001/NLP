"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""Am 50 yrs old in the last 10 years I've had 8 surgeries. I had venus stasis disease on both legs 2 years in total hospitalized and rehab for movement was in a wheelchair for 1 year after was so bad last surgery doctor team told my wife at the time that I have an 80% chance of never walking again.  I  made it through on oxycodone 90mg IR every 6hrs around the clock, it basically got me into trouble.  Long story short I quit the oxy went to pain patch fentanyl..umm  that doctor stopped it and took me off no warning.  So found my old doctor he put me on the 30mg MS contin I take 1 every 10 hrs ..I know some on here say it doesn't work but I would not be able to do anything without it.  It has made what life I do have more worth living ..I thank God for my doctor and God for letting be able to walk again!!"""
"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Chronic Pain""Due to the Opioid problem the VA switched me to Morphine SO4 15 mg three times a day for chronic spinal pain. It was effective for about 5 days. After that, it seems like every pill has a different release pattern. Sometimes I get no relief at all. Why is there so much problem with the release portion and why does somebody not fix it. This is the 21st century. If the VA wants people off Oxycodone, there needs to be a working alternative available so pain sufferers get pain  relief."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I am 61 and I have had six back operations and the fourth worked until I got broadsided on my way home and the seat belts ripped my fusion apart. Two 16 hour operations failed chronic pain was really bad to the point of going insane with the pain. I started with my pain doctor in 1996 and did everything he asked of me and the oral medication allowed me to be kinda human and yes I take 100mgs 60mgs mscontin every 8 hours and 4 15mgs msir and I can be almost a human being. This medication saved my life including my fantastic pain doctor who listens to me and I am very grateful for him and his staff and I would never abuse my meds and each month I bring them to my appt so they can count them strange yes but if you don't abuse them then there is no problem"""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""After years of undiagnosed Crohn's, RA, AS, MS, and FMS (the short list) and finally osteo-related compound and non-compound fractures throughout my whole skeleton from 5 years on methotrexate - I couldn't live without morphine. I use a combination of MS Contin (SR- 60mg/8 hours) and Statex (full release for breakthrough pain). My Crohn's makes me sensitive to every bad side effect of all those 'great' multi-use medicines like gabapentin and Lyrica. So I'm stuck with opioid-based medicines and without them, I couldn't walk. I sleep in a recliner because of bumps on my spine and fractures in my pelvis and walk with a rolling walker. I couldn't live with my pain. I wish more people understood."""
"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I started working construction for my family's company when I was 12, just in the summer and by 18 full time. I wrecked my back by the time I was 30, had my first fusion before I was 35. Now I still suffer chronic pain, severe degenerative disc disease, and I've developed arthritis in my shoulders. My first pain doctor was horrible,  at one point I was taking so much MSContin a day, I was a zombie! Once I got away from him, spent six months working my way off  MSContin, I toughed it out for almost two years. When I couldn't take it anymore and was on the verge of suicide from the pain, I went and found a good pain doctor. Over two years I slowly went back on MsCon, now I take 45mg three times a day. He saved my life and gave me back some quality of life, more than I ever thought I would have.  I've been at the same dose for the past ten years. I've seen both the good and the bad of this med and have no reservations about taking it, my life would suck without it!!"""
"For Chronic Pain""To the nurse saying that DEA doesn't allow doctors to prescribe more than 90 mgs a day of any pain medication ""you are wrong!"" Sorry! Dr's can prescribe as much pain meds as they see fit. Unfortunately like many doctors, nurses, etc., out there, they didn't read, or understand, the bulletin that the DEA sent them. Their recommendation were ""not more than 90 mgs per day"" except for those with severe chronic pain, not just cancer patients (which by the way almost any cancer out there DOESN'T cause pain, it's a false claim! Only a couple types of cancer actually cause pain). Believe me... When my doctor tried to lower my dose, I went straight to the DEA! Oral Morphine does not cause euphoria, it works great on pain but will not get you high at any dose you take."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I have rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, foraminal stenosis, bulging discs, nerve damage in both hands, both knees ""going out"" and bursitis in both hips and I'm only 28 years old. I have been on Lortabs 10/500 and Oxycodone 20mg for years, but they never lasted long enough for my chronic pain. So my doctor tried me on MS Contin 100mg 2 x daily and then Lortab 10/325 for breakthrough pain. WOW, what a difference that was, my pain was more under controlled and I was getting more sleep and was able to do some of the things I used to enjoy."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I find it nearly impossible to see how MS contin 30 is equivalent to 20mg of oxycodone. In comparison, they are night and day different. The MScontin hardly does a thing at all! The oxycodone helped much, much more. Two of my back  doctors took me off it because others abuse it.  Seems the doctor's care more about junkies that chronic pain patients."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I suffer from severe pelvic and abdominal adhesions and severe pelvic pain as a result. It was from a combination of several surgeries, GI issues, endometriosis, bleeding ovarian cysts etc. I am going to be 30 this year and the condition has robbed me of most of my twenties. For years I have tried Percocet, Dilaudid, Lortab, oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, injections in my nerves, Lyrica, topimarate. They only work for a short time and then I have to pretty much live my life around my pain medicine schedule. Then after my last 2 surgeries, the pain got better and was slightly okay with Lortab but not good enough. I started MS Contin 15mg twice a day last week and I have been virtually pain free. I even forget to take the second dose sometimes."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""My fabulous pain management Dr. Just put me on 30mg twice a day I have been taking this dose for a week now, I'm also taking Norco-10/325 up to eight a day and Soma 350mg. I have been taking these medicines for several years now. I have relief from taking the Norco and Soma but it just didn't seem to last as long, would wake up in the middle of the night hurting real bad, but seems like since the Dr has put me on this MS-Contin 30mg twice daily has really helped with constant relief, God bless my Dr. No side effects so far."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I'm 25 years old and have a very long story of how I ended up injured but I have tried everything from you over the counter medications to now the extended release morphine and for the fist time in my life since I was hurt I feel like my self again the only time there is pain is if I had slept in too long or the hour leading up to my next dose. Over all I went from 24 hour round the clock feeling like a bug that was just squished, to only ever having to deal with maybe 3-5 hours of pain a day and it never gets to the point where I'm shaking and crying scared thinking of living that way for the rest of my life. It has helped me be a part of my family again and pulled me out of a deep, deep depression thinking I was just done and useless. I couldn't encourage you more if you know your severely in pain to take about it with your pain specialist."""
"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Pain""After years of lower back pain and 4 pain specialists, I finally found a doctor/team that listen and cared. Switched off of Norco, Vicodin, and numerous other opiates to MS Coton. Went from 60mg/3X a day to 15mg/2X a day and am relatively comfortable and pain free. I operate farm machinery and take care of livestock daily and have for the 5 years I have been on this medication. Never had an accident or made a mistake due to medication. I just hope/wish our politicians can see that these meds have benefits when appropriate and used correctly. They have given me the ability to function and make a living doing what I love."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""I have had chronic, constant migraine for 40 years, complicated by Fibromyalgia which added all over body pain. After years with various short acting pain meds like Lortab and Percocet, my doctor finally tried OxyContin first (worked, but I got tolerant very quickly) and finally MS-Contin, with Percocet as my breakthrough med. My life changed immediately. I take 30mg MS 4 times per day, with up to 3 Percocet.  This dosage has not changed in 15 years, and allowed me to return to work full time. I have a (relatively) normal life with occasional days that are bad.  MS-Continue was not available in generic form when I started and cost a huge amount every month. Happily, it's generic now and extremely affordable. It saved my sanity."""
"Morphine Sulfate IR (morphine) for Chronic Pain""As an RN, I was exposed to massive radiation during Heart Caths, from the Fluoro-tube, as my left side of face was close to the tube during caths. I had reconstructive surgery cuz the radiation destroyed the bones that held my teeth, the left sinus floor, then traveled to my left rib cage, 12 rib fractures from picking up a glass of tea or coughing.  I also have fractured L4, L5, S1 from a 5 roll over car accident.  I've tried Demerol/Phenergan, Oxycodone, Oxycontin, Dilaudid, Vicodin, Percocet, Darvocet, Oromorph. ALL pain meds work differently on different Neuro-pathways. The ONLY med that has ever worked for me, Morphine IR 15mg, 4x day. I took a morphine vacation for one month, then back on Morphine. I can function, work, be productive without being doped up. Extended Release morphine has never worked for bone/nerve pain. Doctors are now regulated by DEA, and cannot prescribe more than 90mg/day of any narcotic. Only end stage cancer patients can get more."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I can’t get through the day without it. While I used to take 200mg/day I’ve been cut back to the 90mg/day & find that while not loving it I can still manage. MSContin (& my breakthrough med which is also morphine based) is the only med that allows me to function & remain clear headed. I do experience some bowel motion problems so I take generic stool softener every day with meals & takes care of that. I’d recommend this to anyone with severe & constant, chronic pain."""
"For Chronic Pain""I have had chronic back/abdominal pain for over 8 years. And I go to pain management. The morphine XR  has given me back my life again.  But the morphine definitely helps with my moderate pain. Unfortunately, now with the possible overdose death of Prince, the government will again tighten up restrictions on legally obtaining pain meds. I'm in NY, and we have some of the strictest controlled substance laws in the country.  These were put in place after several high-profile celebrities who obtained these meds illegally, overdosed. It's not fair that the public has to pay the price for the rich and famous' mistakes. Celebrities will always find a way to ""get around the laws"", while the rest of us pay the price."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""I experience a slipped disc years ago and after a few injections I was still in pain so I was treated with physical therapy, tramadol, OxyContin, and finally morphine. The MS Contin was a God send! I take 2-60mg MsContins a day with 4-15mg instant release for breakthrough pain. Although I only get 8-9hrs relief from a 12 hr pill. I feel 3 times a day for MsContin would keep my levels more steady, but my doc is reluctant to increase it. Sometimes I feel a little tired but the quality of my life has improved dramatically without the high drugged feeling and mood swings of other opiates."""
"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Chronic Pain""Many years ago, I chose medication over surgery to treat severe, chronic pain. Although dependency on pain medication has it's own problems, I still think it was a good choice. I have had almost 20 productive years that I would not otherwise have had. I have learned two things in those years. First, if you are taking Morphine ER, try to arrange your schedule in such a way that you have an hour or two to nap after you take your meds. This medication is more effective if you are sleeping or at rest as it takes effect. Second, avoid oxycodone or oxycontin [time-release oxycodone]. That medication rapidly looses effectiveness and becomes unreliable. For me, the best overall pain med has been Morphine ER.
Hope this helps, and God bless."""
"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I tried using this brand of medicine (imprinted RD 70) for over a year and a half, with NO pain relief AT ALL from this brand! It was so bad that my doctor had to start prescribing a name brand (MS Contin) since CVS will not order any other generic brands, even though this one is ineffective. I was told by a CVS pharmacist that when prescribed Morphine Sulfate ER 15 mg CVS orders the generic Morphine Sulfate ONLY from the brand/company named Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc. / Sun Pharma. This brand is so horrible I will never take any medication they make again!!!"""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I have been a long term sufferer of chronic pain from Fibromyalgia, DDD, Scoliosis, Sciatica, Arthritis, Migraines and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome since 1992.,. After starting out with the over the counter meds, then moving to prescription Motrin, Day trip, Rendering, and numerous anti depressants, my doctor began prescribing Vicodin 5/500. At first they worked, but after 3months, nothing! So I went back to my doctor and told him. He then proceeded to put me on 7.5/750, again they worked for me no longer after 3 months. To make a long story short, I am now and have been on MS Contin, 60mg x two times a day and 100mg at bedtime. For my break-thru pain I am on Oxycodone 30mg x two. I'm here to say that I have a life once again!"""
"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Chronic Pain""As a 21 Year old who has been dealing w/ Chronic Pain since the age of 11. I've been on almost every opiate (Fentanyl, Oxymorphone, Codeine, Methadone, etc) I've found Morphine 30mg every 8 hrs for to be by far the MOST effective out of all opiates. I am rx'd Roxicodone 30mgs 3 times a day for breakthrough pain but I rarely take it as I find it only gives me a 'buzz' & lasts 1-2 hours as far as pain relief is concerned. I am also prescribed Klonopin 1mg t.i.d. prn for PTSD, GAD. Also Adderall 20mg (90) for ADD/Social Anxiety. This combo I've found to be effective for all of my conditions and I truly feel this is the best method for my chronic pain. Yoga helps as well I've found. I suffer from Severe Sciatica, Gallbladder Calculus with acute cholecystitis w/ obstruction, Severe Spondylolisthesis, Severe Thoracic and lumbosacral neuritis, Chronic Pain Syndrome, Scoliosis w/ spinal stenosis, inguinal hernia w/ obstruction, degenerative disc disease. Bilary obstruction, etc."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""I was on 50mgs methadone three times a day for over two years and had pain every day and waking up in the morning was unbearable. I was prescribed MsContin 60 mgs three times a day two days ago and the first morning I woke up, I got right up, went into the kitchen to make my tea and stopped dead in my tracks. Wait a minute, my back doesn't hurt, my body doesn't hurt, I got out of bed without cussing up a storm! This is a miracle. I can't believe it. I'm also on oxycodone 15 mgs 4 times daily for breakthrough pain. My body is now ridding of all the built up toxins from methadone including once a month bowel movements. I'm much happier now."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""While the first 5 years of taking MS Contin seemed to be a better life, my tolerance increased to the point that I was taking nearly a gram a day (1,000 mg). The last 2 years have been spent getting off this medication, and I can assure you it was no cake-walk. I will never use this again, but as I said, when I needed it, it beat every other pain medication I tried hands down."""
"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Chronic Pain""Morphine Sulfate ER 15 mg.
I have been using this for approximately 6 months. I find that many of the side effects listed have become apparent to me. 
I do experience: shakiness, constipation, elevated liver enzymes, difficulty urinating, uncontrollable sleepiness, blurred vision, sensitivity to bright lights at nighttime, including some indoor lighting. In addition, I suffer from stomach pain, feel lethargic at times, memory loss, lack of desire to socialize, depression, and other minor events that I did not have prior to taking morphine."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""This medication gave me my life back! I'm 20, been dealing with chronic testicular and pelvic pain from a sports injury (I tore a muscle in my pelvis which radiates pain to the scrotum). I can't begin to describe how wonderful MS Contin works for my pain. I was on OxyContin 30 mg twice a day and it provided no relief. It was also outrageously expensive. My pain doctor switched me to MS Contin 30 mg twice a day and it's been a Godsend and a lifesaver! It brings my pain down from an 8/10 to a 4/10 and lower! I can now function throughout the day, work, go out places, and spend time with friends. It's affordable, no side effects, and it even gives me a lift!"""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""I have advanced osteoarthritis, disc degenerative disease, foraminal stenosis and central stenosis. In additon, I have had two back surgeries in the last year. I have to take a higher dosage (60mg twice a day) but it allows me to function in a reasonable manner. Without it the pain is excrutiating. Now I can exercise and move."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""This medication was a life saver in the fact that it returned my quality of life back to me.  I was on this medication for over 5 years at 30mg twice daily; never needed an increase in dosage.  What I loved most about this medication was that it was a great pain reliever without the typical ""high"" feeling of opiates.  When insurance didn't cover the medication, I was able to find it at a hospital (Non profit) pharmacy for around $30/month.  The only downside to this medication is coming off of it.  I came off of it when I was pregnant and felt withdrawals for the longest I've ever felt withdrawals from an opiate.  The next time I came off of it, I quit cold turkey, which reduced withdrawal time in half."""
"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Chronic Pain""Been on various opiates since my mid 20s and now I'm mid 50s. If I could choose what ever medicine I wanted for pain relief I would choose Morphine as it is the smoothest, longest lasting and consistent narcotic. Comes on slowly and has long legs. Avoid Oxy as it hits very quickly and falls off often randomly but always sooner. Morphine ER last a good 8 to 12 hrs. Worst side effect long term for me is constipation and occasional hot flashes. Together with Gabapentin and a muscle relaxer mask my sever back injury enough that I can avoid a major risky surgery."""
"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Pain""I am on 2 100mg Morphine Sulfate ER tablets daily. I have been on this for about 2½ years now. It does work well for my pain (blow disc and sciatica in lower back, and Severe RA), but I am very concerned about a side effect that I am having.
My teeth are breaking apart. I had a great set of teeth before I started taking the morphine. Now, after just a little over two years, I have lost 2 molars completely and have 3 molars that are broken and falling apart. My teeth are also starting to stain badly, no matter how much I brush them. My molars are constantly causing me a lot of pain.
After researching a bit here online, I now realize that it is the morphine causing my teeth to just break and fall apart. Any Help Please???"""
"MorphaBond ER (morphine) for Chronic Pain""Garbage.  No pain relief!  Should never have been approved, The study they did was  they gave it to 25 junkies and asked them if they would abuse it, why should I care, what about people suffering in pain? Did they test it to see if stopped pain? It doesn't release the medication!  Why not cover pills in stainless steel, then there is zero chance of efficacy, isn't that the goal? If there is micro-plastic in everyone's bodies and the environment, what is the cumulative effect of the ingredients in this garbage? Who wants a build up in their gut of some toxic plastic rubber covering? But more than that, for the dying, the person in serious pain, it doesn't release the medication, period. I know this was approved so the FDA could appear to be 'doing something' about ILLEGAL drugs, follow that logic, all this will do is harm people in agony.  While costing a fortune. Dangerous to give to people in serious pain, if suicides occur on it, because it doesn't work, don't be surprised."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""Taking MS Contin 30mg four times a day for over five years. I use 4mg Hydromorphone for immediate release, breakthrough pain when and if needed. Usually (if needed) the Hydromorphone dose required is about 8 mg.  Because I am taking these medicines for a serious back injury in which I suffered 3 crushed vertebra, occasionally the pain gets out of control. Usually after ill-advised physical activity at a level beyond that which I am accustomed to. At those times it often requires the MS Contin and a dose of Dilaudid (Hydromorphone) to bring the pain back to a controlled level. When taking MS Contin and Hydromorphone together, there is a period of drowsiness that passes in about 1/2 hour. I just make sure I am not driving or out and about if such a dose is needed."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""After years of just plain Percocet 10/325, Ms-Contin is a miracle. I can actually feel like a human being again. I've had C3, 4 & 5 fused. C1 & 2 are in bad shape and they are scared to perform any more surgery. My left rotator cuff is ""gone"" and irreparable. Rothman Institute said it will only get worse, nothing more can be done. Right rotator cuff is not as bad, still have 2 surviving (barely) tendons.  Both knees are destroyed and will soon need replaced. Ms-Contin with 10mg Oxycodone 3 x daily for breakthrough pain have given me my life back again, (as much as possible.)"""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I was in a really bad car wreck in which I had temporary paralysis due to C3 and C4 fractures and was in a halo for almost 4 months. I would have never survived physical therapy and everyday movement with out this medication."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""I had anterior lumbar fusion - implants, plates you name it, in November 2008.   My third surgery - Post operation, I was sure something went wrong due to the agonizing 24/7 pain. I was taking combination of 12-14 Norcos or Percocets a day.  Was shocked by how much pain pills I was burning through. My surgeon could find anything wrong. All in all, a humbling, frightening experience. Then I was prescribed MS-Contin and the agony is over.  Now I'm planning to return to work. I'm walking again. My wife is weeping with joy instead of mourning.

MS-Contin saved my life."""
"Morphine Sulfate IR (morphine) for Chronic Pain""After getting a bad infection meningitis I had some long term damage. I have migraines daily and fibromyalgia and interstitial cystitis. I can't take most pain medication because it can make it worse. Morphine is the only one that has worked for me & I'm able to live a life!  It's been 7 years and my dose has stayed the same. I take morphine sulphate IR 30, 3 times a day. No side effects no more.  I can drive & it doesn't affect daily activities. But be careful it causes constipation. So if you are on it I recommend that you take a stool softener & vitamins."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""I have been on this for a while and if not for the drug I would not come close to a normal life. I still hurt but this makes it manageable. The dosage has been changed twice in 8 years.  Spurs, 3 bulging discs, metal, pins and screws from a previous operation. Total success until I felt I have Osteo in my whole spine. Even if they would operate, I have had the spinal shots, I would still have to take medication. It saved me from no life at all. """
"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Chronic Pain""The Ranbaxy manufacturer morphine medication works differently than what was prescribed at different pharmacy. I will be going back to previous pharmacy which carries different manufacturer. The Ranbaxy/Sun 15 mg ER tablets are inconsistent. For past two weeks taken this medication, I have been nauseous and vomiting after 4 hours, get real sleepy occasionally after one hour, not holding pain as usual for 12 hours. Something is really wrong with this extended relief medication. Will let CVS know this medication needs further review. Doubt anyone will take notice since it is a pain medication that government and doctors view as a patient problem."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I had a spinal stroke 8 months ago, spinal cord infarction, that has left me in a wheelchair, and around the clock pain. I begin taking Ms Contin in December, 15mg 2x a day, along with Tramadol, Lyrica, and Percocet  10/325.  I was able to cut way back on the Percocet and Tramadol once I begin the morphine, and have been able to continue so until the middle of March.  My pain is not responding as well since my tolerance has obviously increased.  I have talked to my doctor about this and am going to go up to 30mg twice daily beginning in April.  Morphine has allowed me to pretty much cut out two pain medications while providing a more consistent pain relief."""
"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Chronic Pain""In 2001, I had knee surgery. The surgeon cut a nerve and I’ve been in chronic pain since then. The surgeon didn’t care. My GP went through many combinations of medications. I was relieved when he put me on Morphine Sulfate ER 60mg (with Gabapentin and Ibuprofen). Taking this twice a day, I no longer want to break things or am aggressive. I hope the government realizes that pain medication is necessary, even though others abuse it."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""It is unbelieveable.  I have hurt so badly and for so long.,  Finally I got a caring Doctor that actually listened to me.  He spent about 45 minutes talking to me.  I have had a spinal fusion and both hips replaced.  The discs above and below the fusion are going bad  I found a doctor that prescribed the MS and I am almost pain free.  I am afraid to take a deep breath.  It has been so long since I could do the most ordinary things like push the grocery cart and walk up an incline.  I think this drug is wonderful.  I haven't had the up and down ride you get with hydrocodone,"""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I was taking upwards of 10-10/325 Percocets a day and still having knee pain that would prevent me from getting up in the morning, I suffer from chronic patella dislocation among several other knee issues. Taking 60mg MSContin 3  times a day is a God send. I'm down to 2-3 Percocet for the break through pain but the MSContin has helped me get through the day and be able to play with my son. I thank my doctor and pharmacist every month."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""I have chronic lower back and leg pain. It's been over 20 years now. After several surgeries I have decided against letting another surgeon touch me. 

MSCONTIN is a Godsend! I sleep all night and don't wake up feeling horrible and barely able to move. The days are better too. I don't have those 8-10 level pain days anymore. I still have pain, but it's much more controlled."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""I have been on this medicine, changing from 30 mg MS Contin twice a day and 60 MG at night, to 60 mg MS Contin 3 times a day, going on two weeks now. I am also still taking my 15 mg Oxycodone immediate release for breakthrough pain, taking that 5 times a day as well. All I can say is ""Yay"" for my doctor. I have my life back. I am working two job and also I am able to ride my bicycle now. If not for my pain management doctor treating my pain with these medicines, I wouldn't be able to do any of this. The 60 mg MS Contin works hand in hand with the oxycodone. I went from total 100 per cent days of severe pain and extreme knee cramps and locking up, to almost no pain days, totally pain free with this medicine. What a relief."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""Took my pain from a 9 to a 2! Lasts all day and rarely have to take my break through pain medication. I have ADHD, Chronic Pain, Panic Attack Disorder.

MS Contin, 180 twice a day

6mg when required of Xanax IR
Adderall, 30mg IR twice a day"""
"Kadian (morphine) for Pain""After reading so many people say that Kadian gave them so much relief from their chronic pain I was willing to give it a try. I had been taking Oxycodone 30mg 4 X's a day and felt amazing but they are now trying to get rid of all Oxycodone and Oxycontin because it has become such an epidemic on the street. So, we had to switch to something else. She started me on Kadian 60mg 2 X's a day with Percocet 10s every 6 hrs. The Kadian does absolutely nothing for my pain so she increased it to 80mg and still no relief. I have degenerative disc disease, a bulging disc and fibromyalgia. Oxycodone was the only thing that seemed to help."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""I have suffered for many years with AS and Degenerative Disc disease. With all the NSAIDs, Methotrexate, and pain killers I developed ulcers in my esophagus, stomach and duodenum. Thankfully my Doctor decided to switch me to Morphine because it is easier on the system. Now I take 60 mg MS Contin twice a day and 4 to 6mg Dilaudid as needed for breakthrough pain. The plus is that the ulcers have all healed and although the pain is not totally gone it is very manageable. The minus is that I have had to gradually increase my dosage over the years because your body learns to tolerate it. Adjusting to a new dose can take a little while and it causes constipation (Benifiber works great)."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I was on a lot of pain medications but found myself on three 60mg Morphines and four 15 mg Oxycodone up until my doctor of 10 years moved when I was forced tapered down to 90mgs a day of Morphine. I was booted out of my pain place and tracked down my former doc, and he force tapered me down to 45mgs a day of Morphine no breakthrough medicines.

"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""This medicine has been a God send miracle for me! I suffer from spinal stenosis, 4 herniated discs and nerve damage in both legs. I injured myself in 2007 and my chronic pain has steadily increased.

I have been treated with different pain medicines over the last few years including Percocet, Hydrocodone and Morphine. The problem I had on the others was, while they helped, they would give me a numb feeling. I enjoying reading and... well... thinking! So that wasn't enjoyable for me.

The MS-Contin works odd to me, I can't really explain why but I get all the pain relief with none of the high feeling that makes you about as active as a slug. This medicine can cause constipation."""

Been on it for a year now, same dosage. Before time-release pain meds, I was in SO much pain.  Now, I'm nearly pain free and its given me my life back.  I can't do too much strenuous walking, but can do things like run errands or take my daughter to the mall.

In my opinion, the sickness is worse than coming off of Percocet, Vicodin, etc. Don't know why that is but that's just what I expect for myself.   I know all about slowly cutting down your doses and all and I surely didn't expect it 2 be rainbows and sunshine, but in my experience it was worse than the DT's you get from the others I mentioned.

Just bring back AVINZA, as I know there has to be other people like me, though I fear from experience- that we who suffer from Chronic Pain, are looked at as irrelevant, and why AVINZA was taken away from us!"""

I can't imagine what my life would be like without the pain relief I get from Kadian.  I tried Fentanyl patch with no relief (then I heard of the deaths caused by the patch), and tried Oxycontin and again no relief, so Kadian is for me.  Only issue is it is extremely expensive."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I began taking mscontin 30mg twice daily about 11 years ago due to a chronic pain condition caused by , in a large part , by lack of treatment due to no insurance.

This medication has always kept my level of pain at a point where I could function in a manner where my quality of life increased , although I am unable to work because my left arm is basically useless. It's main drawback for me is that like with all opioids tolerance does occur and dosing increases are sometimes necessary. I also take , for BT pain , tylenol #4 , 1 or 2 tabs every 4-6 hrs when required I would personally recommend this medication to anyone with chronic pain issues."""

The only side effect I have had from it, is a slowed digestive system, but I have never had to use anything for the slowed digestive tract.
It just angers me so when morphine medicine is so often talked bad about, as it saved my life, & it is one of the best medicines for how well it works when used correctly- & just like how all medicines should be used correctly. Nothing else has ever eased my pain at all like morphine medicine. I used two different doses for past 26 years, as first dose had never been enough."""

I never once took it other than prescribed and there is no doubt in my mind I was physically addicted to it.

It no longer works at current dose and doctor won't move up a dose, and doesn't believe in short-acting medicines. First 6 months it really did wonders and gave me a lot of my life back. Constipation is brutal with this medicine - I take Miralax daily with some relief. Withdrawals are horrific."""
"For Pain""I had a discectomy in 2015. I was prescribed 90 Morphine Sulfate ER 12 hour tablets (red) at discharge. I only took half the bottle during recovery for pain and saved the rest until today, when I ran out of a 5 day supply of OxyContin prescribed for upper jaw surgery on 8/27/19. They are still effective as ever. I don't have an addictive nature so I know I'll be fine taking them. My jaw pain was at a 8, on fire. Asked my surgeon for another 5 days worth of Oxy but she declined. I realize there is an opioid epidemic so I understand why. I think in a few days I can cease taking them as swelling will go down. I am thankful I had saved them. I'm here because I wanted to see reviews but a lot reviews are  only complaints. Morphine is for dying cancer patients/unbearable emergency nerve pain. It should not be prescribed for everyday use due to it's potency. There are other meds for all other pain cases. Don't be mad at your doc for not wanting to prescribe it because it is really addictive."""

I've experienced nearly every side effect, worst being respiratory problems and weight gain. My attitude has been poor and I'm completely miserable. It's increased my depression. For all the horrible side effects I've experienced, it doesn't seem worth it to stay on the medication for MINOR pain relief. The same has happened to me with Lyrica (neurontin with a prettier name) and tramadol ER. Morphine is by far the worst. I gave it 2 weeks but I can't take anymore of the nausea and illness this medication has caused. I took a morning dose today and feel ill, as usual. I can't wait to flush this garbage from my system."""

Also crushed, herniated and bulging discs in my entire lower lumbar region.  Have been in unmanageable pain many times before trying MS Contin.  This seems to give me the best possible relief while still allowing me to function in society. The pain is now under control and I do live a normal life.  I take Soma, a muscle relaxer, and that seems to help when I overdo things.  I am perscribed 4 of the 60mg in the a.m. and 4 in the p.m. without side effects."""
"Kadian (morphine) for Chronic Pain""Kadian has been an amazingly​ helpful medication for me. I take 14 medications daily, four of those medications are for severe pain. And until the doctor added Kadian the pain just was not giving me any breaks. I have been on Kadian for about four years now I would rather die than miss even one dose as it's that important to the quality of my life. To be fair I do have some side effects I consider to be mild and not worth even mentioning one thing to say that is important I am physically addicted to this medicine missing a dose makes me sick sick sick but then again I don't miss doses anyway because of my pain levels however the pharmacy doc or insurance will mess up once in awhile so I do suffer missing doses once in awhile"""
"For Chronic Pain""As the Morphine was effective the more lasting effective was unexpected.  I lost 12 teeth.  A side affect?  I don't have any other explanation.  The health of my teeth was great before the 18 months of morphine.  I was finally referred to a back pain specialist.  I was to get off all medications to receive the injections.  Cold turkey was the same as described any heroin withdrawal. But I survived.  I am taking a strong anti inflammatory twice a day that seems to after 9 years keep the pain and the sciatica at bay.  I still have numbness in my toes but that is nerve damage from the inflammation.  I live with that.  My lack of upper teeth to chew my food is uncomfortable and embarrassing, no more smiles for me.  No money for replacements."""

"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I have CRPS and have tried a variety of treatments, i.e. ganglion nerve blocks, TENS, Oxy, etc. and found that the Morphine ER works best for pain along with gabapentin.

I have been having the infusions for about 2 years until my Medicare Advantage plan reduced reimbursement to the provider, and the Pain Management provider dropped the procedure."""
"For Chronic Pain""Doc prescribed ever increasing doses of both IR and ER for 8+ years until I was at 375-400 mg/day. I am retired now and don't need these high daily doses. I am severely addicted and on my 5th attempt to stop. I tried 3 cold and 1 methadone until I understood, methadone may get you off morphine, then you are addicted to that and need to taper. I live in Thailand, they don't have naloxone or suboxone and I wouldn't use it if they did. This is 100% from hospital pain management, not the street. In 6 weeks I have cut from 375 mg/day to just 20 now, September 14, 2023, and if I got this far, this time, I am too badass not to see the finish line. Addiction and withdrawal are REAL... an evil place you never want to go. Be very, very careful with dosing and how you feel, only take what you need when you really need it. DO NOT take 100 mg/day because the Doc prescribed it. Keep dosing as low as you can, and MOST IMPORTANT... STOP THEM as quick as"""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""This is a life saver. I have many conditions that leave me in pain 24-7. I have been taking oxycodone for years and never got much relief. If I did, it wasn't very long and made me feel buzzed, I guess you would call it. My doctor switched me to 30mg MS Contin, and it has been a blessing. I don’t feel that buzzed feeling and have level pain relief all day and night. This medication is more natural than all the other opioid drugs. It is made from the poppy and not a lab."""
"Kadian (morphine) for Chronic Pain""After an MVA when I was 17 and having been on many opiates to combat compression fractures, muscle damage, and arthritis in my neck, shoulder, and back, I was put on Kadian approximately 2 and a half years ago. While doing further research I took notice that one major side-effect was not mentioned. While helping with the pain, the drug made my nose run uncontrollably which has been making my life unbearable and I'm not the only one who has noticed. As a result, I am going to make the switch to Suplocade."""

Pros:
● Have not had to increase dose in 12+ years
● Good pain control
● Take dose every 12 hours and can function without constantly thinking of my chronic pain, which is greatly appreciated

Cons:
● Definitely have developed a physical dependence on medication"""

"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""During a very bad period of face pain from Trigeminal neuralgia I call those flares, this one was particularly awful and I was afraid to even speak because of the sensitivity, I went to the ER and they prescribed me seven MS Contin 30mg pills. it worked really well, I was a bit, I'd say sedated, but I could drink water and eat food without it feeling like someone took a glowing hot drill and put it through my nose and eye. It didn't get rid of the pain, but it made it much less triggerable and it made the pain less intense when I for example answered a question. When I was a child I got attacked by a dog, and this isn't related to the pain from TGN but it puts it into perspective, during the attack half of my face was torn off by the teeth, not deep enough to damage anything or bleed heavily, but still was the color of raw steak, the pain of the dog ripping a layer of skin off half of my face was an 8 compared to the neuralgia at that times which was a 10.

When the doctor put me on morphine, I couldn't believe how much better I felt and I'm not tired or groggy at all. I can function really well and I'm so thankful that my pain management doctor put me on morphine. I did want to mention one thing. It seems to start wearing off about 3 hours after you take your immediate release pill.

The side effects made me lose my appetite which caused significant weight lose. The benefits were that it was able to keep me (for the most part) functioning. My dosage was 10mg and I was to take 2 tablets every 6 hours, max 4/day. As a recovering addict of 4 years coming up, it was pretty manageable for me to maintain by myself.

   Enter Pain Mgmt.: 7 various spinal blocks + Gabapentin/ Prednisone/Tramadol/ Butrans/ Oxy/ Methadone ~ ONLY partial relief came from high Morphine IM/MS Contin & Fentanyl IM/Patch.  I HATE meds BUT they have SAVED MY LIFE.  Literally. (ya'll know what I mean) Thank God!!!  Peace out.  Matt"""
"For Chronic Pain""I was taking oxymorphone 30 they told me they were taking them off the market.  I found out they are not taking them off the market but I was put on arymo 15 mg which is no where near as effective as oxymorphone 30 mg"""
"For Chronic Pain""Morphine is typically administered in a hospital setting through IV. They take this route because pain relief is essentially instant. The main difference w/these coated pills, while they are a higher milligram (60mg), I was given anywhere from 2 to 4mg through my IV. Some would say the upside through your IV, is the instant relief (in the ER, that's the point),but the duration of relief (some say),is shorter than that of the pills, which by design are rated to last 12 hrs. The info along w/the script says the coating is there because it's an extended-release tablet, hence the 12hr rating for pain relief. They make an immediate release pill but for home use most dr's will script these. Sometimes norco is added for immediate relief as needed."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I find this form of medication to be an extremely poor waste of money. I am able to control my severe chronic pain much better with the immediate form. Instead of having to try to adjust my dosage to match my level of pain which changes in a short period of time I am using a form that may take hours to stabilize. This is somewhat like using a blunt object rather than a sharp knife to deal with my pain."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""Thankfully my pain management doctor has found a combination of medications that has given me some relief from my chronic pain and I can have a better quality of life."""
"Kadian (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I have been using Kadian for at least 9 years now.  I haven't ever had the need to increase dosage, unlike Oxy etc.
My pharmacy wholesaler stopped carrying Kadian a few months ago and I have been sick ever since.  Headaches, loose bowels and G.I. distress.  I am searching for Kadian without much luck."""

"Morphine Sulfate SR (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I get the generic brand from Teva and take two 60mg tabs in the a.m. and two 60 mg tabs in the evening.  I find that the generic wears off too early probably 1 and 1/2 hours early and when pain is severe l need something else as well.  Maybe the generic is not as good as brand name so l wish l could try the brand name so l can find out."""
"Oramorph SR (morphine) for Chronic Pain""Very similar to MS Contin before manufacturer added a second drug-release regulating feature to the matrix. I found that every 12 hours allowed too low a trough in between doses, so my dose was divided into thirds for a  every 8 hour schedule.  I continued to work throughout the titration and stayed productive for a decade. Now I'm toast.  Any steady-state pain strategy will eventually change your body chemistry for ever, so it important to exhaust  all short-acting, prn ""as needed"" strategies first.  Be honest with your Doctor, it goes a long way."""

"For Chronic Pain""The morphine sulfate has been the best of all the trials my doc and I went through. Found out 7 years ago got massive damage from degenerative disc disease, stenosis and arthritis. After surgery and loosing 160 lbs the pain was just as bad or worse, so off to the pain management route my doc and I go.  I must say that I am extremely fortunate to have a doc that is not afraid to help me. She and I have a great relationship.  Mind you, I do my part, all clean drug tests, no early visits and follow the directives. I have a pain contract with her that I honor as well. We have been on 80mgOC/4 day, fentanyl 100mcg/48hrs. and everything in between. The morphine is what I have been on the longest and has by far worked the best. Been on it for 4 years. Pain Sucks.."""
"For Chronic Pain""To DESERTFOX I have found that  methadone to be the best pain med. I am no longer foggy from large doses of morphine and 10 times better for my pain. Good luck!"""
"For Chronic Pain""Machine guns are heavy & so is everything else in life. But my broken body hurts from the moment I wake up till sleep. Like one guy said, no doc in Ky will help you, so I have to self medicate. I have taken just about everything known for pain, I have been thru it all. All of these new drugs Roxy's 10-20-30 mg's are meant to get you hooked, Hooked and still in pain. But I never have pain or withdraws when I take these 15mg extended release. If you have a tolerance you'll need at least 30-45mg's in one dose. 

honestly, these are without a doubt the best for pain I've taken thus far. No buzz & no pain"""

"For Chronic Pain""I'm trying to find whether instant release morphine pills will be better than what I am currently taking..I am 26 and after an injury at work I found out I have degenerative disc disease, at first I was on an array of meds and now I take 30mg OxyContin 2x a day, but same as all long release pills it doesn't kick in for 3 hours, makes me sicker than a dog only lasts for a few hours and just all around killing my life. I found that 10mg oxycodone pills 4 times a day work 10x better but my doctor clearly stated he won't give them to me and kept me on the OxyContin. I was just wondering on the comparison of oxy 10mg and the morphine so I can state my case to my back specialist next month."""
"For Chronic Pain""I did not use this often but when I needed it as pain was so bad it took it away within 10 mins. Fantastic stuff if used in the right way"""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Pain""I have degenerative disc disease and had spinal fusion and stenosis surgery in my lower back. For years I have been on Norco 7.5mg/325 (1 pill 4x a day as needed.) and for the most part that took care of my pain. Roughly the past year my dr decided to reduce the Norco by half and added MS Contin. 15mg 1 pill twice a  day. It didn't help much. For me it takes the MS Contin three hours for me to notice any difference and it only helps for about six hours leaving three hours before I can take another. He upped it to 30mg in the morning and 15mg at night. Still not seeing anything different. This Friday I am going to ask him if I can just go back on the Norco at my old regiment. It seemed to work better for me then these extended release meds."""
"Morphine Sulfate ER (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I've tried MS Contin a few times over the years and finally given up. What I really liked was good pain control without the euphoria or crash of IR products like oxycodone. What I didn't like was, after a few weeks, developing hallucinations and delusions that were so... real. I actually listed it as an allergy on my med records. Others tolerate it well. I'm not them though. Morphine derivatives like Dilaudid cause me no problems. It sucks, and is terrifying, to wake up convinced the bed is covered in spiders, to the point of seeing them. Not for me."""
"MS Contin (morphine) for Chronic Pain""I was dizzy really bad first dose and felt weird. Had trouble seeing but I finally got some sleep. Those feelings only lasted 2 doses. I was on 15mg ER.

"Infumorph (morphine) for Chronic Pain""Diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2006, but I'm fairly sure it was there for at least another 10 years prior. I have a carer and I'm really grateful for the family I have and their unadulterated kindness. I don't know where I'd be without them.
 Over the last decade, I have been put on more medicines than I can count. Pain relief; everything from diamorphine epidural to tramadol; or ketamine to fentanyl. Having never been one to rely overly on medicine.
 Oxycodone HCL (Shortec) worked very well for about 2 years, then the doctor upped the dose 50% with minimal benefit. I have been prescribed oral morphine liquid, slow release capsules which work consistently as a medicine, particularly the ampoules. Minimal side effects, huge relief."""
"For Chronic Pain""My experience with MS ER 15 mg is it didn't help at all the MS IR 15 mg worked better. Now Does anyone know the differences between MS ER and MS SR? I think they gave me the wrong script. I always take 30 mg of MS ER and today was given MS SR."""
"For Pain""This medication to me, doesn't make you too loopy, however it does numb your body which is what it is supposed to do. I prefer dilaudid over this medicine, however it does work."""

But you can't control the amount of medicine entering your system, it's unpredictable, certain brands are being recalled because of defective pouches. Plain old morphine. It's been around forever and nothing works as well. The only problem is I've grown tolerant and needed 2 increases in the past year. I guess that will happen with any medication.

I have to have it so I'm glad that I can take this and not feel sick or have any side effects that are bad. I'm on the 100mg tablets for two weeks my doctor said that he is going to up the dose after the surgery and put me on something else to. Then I go right back on my Suboxone Plan.

They finally started Kadian and over the years they have had to up the dose. I'm currently at 600mg - 3 X 200mg capsules once a day.
It doesn't remove the pain but keeps it just below the surface so I can still get around.

"Morphine Sulfate IR (morphine) for Chronic Pain""My doctor prescribes Morphine Sulfate IR 15, to me for chronic pain.

I have not, and refuse to, seek any other habit forming drugs from my doctor.

It seems that if he'd adjusted it and given me something for break through pain maybe I would have had a good outcome, too. Sadly, I have no health insurance now and it's too expensive, so maybe he did me a favor. It would've been brutal to finally have a medicine work and it be too expensive to buy."""

Now that they have MRI's of the damage suffered 26 years ago that has degenerated over the years, they believe me and will finally titrate me up to 90mg of Avinza, which is a wonder for me.

They said if this doesn't do the job, they will send me to a major pain clinic. I've been to pain clinics and it seems all they want to do is ween you off opiates and don't do much about the pain.
